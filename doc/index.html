This is a collection of examples to demonstrate the use 
of <a href="http://homac.cakelab.org/projects/JavaBlend">Java .Blend</a>.
The collection comprises a data model generated by Java .Blend for
Blender v2.78.
</p>


<h2>Project Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>gen</code>: Generated data model to access data in Blender v2.78 files.</li>
<li><code>src</code>: Java .Blend Viewer - An Application to display Blender scenes in Java.</li>
<li><code>jb-examples</code>: Various examples and a demo application.</li>
<li><code>resources</code>: Blender files and glsl shaders required by the demo application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Model</h2>
<p>The source code of the data model is located in folder <code>gen</code>.
It was generated for Blender version 2.78 and all Blender files
used in the examples are of version 2.78. Refer to 
<a href="http://homac.cakelab.org/projects/JavaBlend">Java .Blend</a> 
to download or generate different versions of the data model.
</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Example Java .Blend Viewer Application</h3>
<b>Files: </b><code>src/*</code><br/>
<p>
The application reads a given Blender file and displays it. It will 
start in a Debug View, which shows normals and camera orientation as 
well as key-bindings (use F1-key to see regular view).
</p>
<p>
<b>DISCLAIMER:</b> This application and the underlying render engine 
are WORK IN PROGRESS. Currently, its purpose is to demonstrate how 
you 'can' access data in .blend files through Java .Blend. Its purpose 
is not to explain rendering of that data in OpenGL, even though it does.
</p>
<p>
The application is based on <a href="http://lwjgl.org">LWJGL</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML">JOML</a> and contains an 
object-oriented abstraction layer (org.cakelab.soapbox and org.cakelab.oge). 
</p>
<p>
The most important part of the application is found in the package 
<code>src/org.cakelab.blender.io</code>. There you will find a class <code>BlenderInput</code>,
which offers all kinds of methods to retrieve data from an associated 
blender file using the generated DNA classes. BlenderInput uses two
converter classes located in the same package:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ConvertBlender2OpenGL</code>Converts data of the .blend file 
in internal representations used by the underlying render system in 
<code>org.cakelab.soapbox</code>.</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Example: Converting <code>.blend</code> to JSON</h3>
<b>File: </b><code>org/cakelab/blender/io/input/ExampleConvert2Json.java</code><br/>
<p>
This example demonstrates how to implement a class which converts the whole
Blender file into a JSON representation. The example makes use of the java reflection
API to perform its task on top of the generated data model. This approach was just 
used to further demonstrate the use of the data model.
</p>
<p>
The conversion allows to easily visualise the content of a Blender file which helps in
understanding the meaning of member variables of classes in the generated data model.
</p>

<h3>Example: Exchanging Data with Blender via Copybuffer</h3>
<b>File: </b><code>jb-examples/org/cakelab/blender/io/output/ExampleCopybufferExchange.java</code><br/>
<p>
Blender provides a clipboard functionality of its own kind. On <code>CTRL+C</code>
Blender copies selected objects into a temporary .blend file which is stored in 
<code>/tmp/copybuffer.blend</code> (I guess it's <code>%APPDATA%/..</code> on windows).
Accordingly, on <code>CTRL+V</code> the content of this file is pasted in the currently
selected scene. 
</p>
<p>
The example code in <code>ExampleCopybufferExchange.java</code>
demonstrates how to fill the copybuffer with a mesh (simple cube with texture).
</p>

<h3>Example: Creating new Blocks</h3>
<b>File: </b><code>jb-examples/org/cakelab/blender/io/output/ExampleCreateNewBlocks.java</code><br/>
<p>The factory class of the generated data model (see gen/org/cakelab/blender/utils/BlenderFactory.java) 
provides several methods to create new blocks for structs, arrays and pointers. This example provides 
multiple examples to demonstrate the use of those methods.
